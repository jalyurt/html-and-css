# pros:
-page looks authentic, finished feel

-eye for detail (f.e. pg up button, linking to existing page, etc)

-neat and organized file structure

-lots of comments (including closing div ones)

-media queries in separate partial: very handy

-good use of nesting and imports, very neat feeling (though class-names can be confusing, f.e.: nav bars)

# cons:
-slow start, had to fork/pull request several times

-1st version linked to ' reset ' partial without there being one present.
 2nd version had two ' reset ' partials (one without an underscore which made it impossible for the CSS to find the proper link)  

 -use of gradient which wasn't a variable

 -not adaptive to mobile (nor responsive)

 -text decoration on links

 -border radius on heading but not on body box

 -nitpicking time: some names are with hyphens, others with camel-casing, etc

 -mistake in progress bars (80% instead of 100%), couldn't find it in CSS, later on found out it had inline-style in the HTML
